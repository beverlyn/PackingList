## 🌟 Features
- 📋 Effortlessly create multiple lists, add and remove items on the go, and tick them off as you complete them ✅
- 💾 Worry-free data caching ensures your lists stay intact so you never lose track of them 

## 🌱 Background
This practice project was born from my desire to tackle challenges related to user input and data manipulation, such as changing list names, editing items, and marking them as complete. It's a hands-on exploration of managing and transforming user-provided data in an intuitive way. 🛠️

## 📚 Learnings
- 💡 Mastered the art of data caching for seamless user experiences
- 🍍 Deepened my understanding of Vue Pinia, an innovative state management framework and store library tailored for Vue.js
- 🤝 Developed insights into user needs, focusing on what they seek while creating and managing lists
- 🧠 Navigated through the nuances of data saving based on user interactions - from hitting enter to navigating away from a page 

## 🤔 Future plans
These are ideas I have if I have time to revisit this project in the future
- 🗓️ Implement sorting by date of creation or last updated, for improved list organization
- ↕️ Introduce the ability to reorder items, giving users complete control over list structure 
- 🔍 Add a filter for completed tasks, allowing for a clearer view of what's pending and what's done. 
- ⬇️ Automatically move completed tasks to the bottom of the list, keeping the focus on pending items
